In this project, our client aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of how their product listings compared to those of their competitors. Additionally, they wanted to monitor and analyze online discussions and sentiments surrounding their products in relation to their competitors. To achieve this, I developed ethical web scrapers that adhered to website policies and guidelines to collect competitor data.

Using these web scrapers, we systematically retrieved data from competitor websites while ensuring compliance with ethical scraping practices. The collected data encompassed various aspects of competitor product listings, such as pricing, features, and customer reviews. We prioritized ethical scraping to maintain respect for website guidelines and to ensure data privacy and integrity.

The collected competitor data was then stored and organized in a data warehouse. This data warehouse served as a centralized repository for all the acquired information, facilitating efficient data management and analysis. We utilized the power of Tableau, a robust data visualization tool, to create visually appealing dashboards and reports.

By leveraging the collected data within Tableau, we generated comprehensive visualizations and reports that provided our client with valuable insights. The visuals allowed for a quick and comprehensive comparison of their product listings against those of their competitors. Furthermore, by monitoring online discussions and sentiments, we could gauge the sentiment and perception of the client's products compared to those of their competitors.

The insights derived from our visualizations and reports empowered our client to make data-driven decisions. The information gleaned from these analyses enabled them to identify areas of improvement in their product listings, align their pricing strategies, and understand customer sentiments and preferences. Ultimately, these insights played a significant role in guiding their business strategies and decisions.

As a direct result of our efforts, our client witnessed tremendous success. Their competitor launched their biggest product yet, resulting in the largest sales in their product listing history. This outcome showcases the significance of data-driven insights and the impact they can have on business growth and market competitiveness.

Our commitment to ethical web scraping practices, meticulous data collection and organization, and insightful visualizations were instrumental in providing our client with a competitive edge in the market.
