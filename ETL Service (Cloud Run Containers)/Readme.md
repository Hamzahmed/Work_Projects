## [ETL Service (Cloud Run Containers)](https://github.com/Hamzahmed/Work_Projects/tree/main/ETL%20Service%20(Cloud%20Run%20Containers))
As a key driver of our company's data consolidation initiative, I spearheaded the development of a robust cloud environment to streamline the centralization of our Method data, previously scattered across various locations. Following a meticulous evaluation of potential solutions, we strategically opted for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and its suite of powerful tools to anchor this transformative endeavor.

To seamlessly bridge our Salesforce data into the cloud environment, we discreetly introduced an internal tool named 'Eagle' (name changed for confidentiality). This tool served as a conduit for retrieving data from Salesforce into an MSSQL Server database. Our subsequent challenge involved transferring this data from SQL Server into BigQuery, encompassing approximately 20 tables (Shown ETL for 2 tables here), each with distinct schemas and configurations.

To address this, I engineered docker containers designed for deployment on Cloud Run via Artifact Registry on GCP. These containers were programmed to efficiently extract data from the SQL Server and seamlessly migrate it to BigQuery. The process involved a comprehensive initial data load, followed by subsequent incremental loads facilitated through Change Tracking (CT enabled on MS SQL Server).

Given the security constraints of the network-protected MS SQL Server, I implemented a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network and routed Cloud Run traffic to specific IP addresses generated through Cloud Subnets. These designated IP addresses were then whitelisted on the SQL Server, allowing seamless data transmission to Google Cloud.

In addition, I established [Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows](https://github.com/Hamzahmed/Work_Projects/tree/hamzacommit/ETL%20Service%20(Cloud%20Run%20Containers)/CICD%20Deployment)) on GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of docker containers upon committing changes to the company's repository. These workflows meticulously validate authentication, scripts, deploy containers into Artifact Registry, and orchestrate their execution on Cloud Run, ensuring a streamlined and efficient process.
