## [Missing Data](https://github.com/Hamzahmed/Work_Projects/tree/main/Missing%20Data)

Introducing our data validation script, a powerful tool developed to ensure the completeness and accuracy of our project's data. This script plays a crucial role in validating whether any data rows are missing from a given table, making it an essential component of our data validation process.

By running this script, we can quickly identify any gaps or inconsistencies in our data, enabling us to take prompt action and address any potential issues. The script serves as a proactive measure to ensure that all necessary data rows are present, minimizing the risk of incomplete or unreliable analyses.

As we continue our project, this data validation script will serve as a reliable checkpoint, providing us with the confidence that our data is complete and consistent. By leveraging this tool, we can maintain the highest standards of data integrity, ensuring that our insights and decisions are based on accurate and reliable information.

Through the implementation of this script, we demonstrate our commitment to delivering high-quality results and upholding the utmost standards of data reliability and validity.
